Kirk attracted fervent crowds, bringing young people into conservative politics, while at the same time shocking some with provocative opinions.

In an exclusive BBC interview, Sundar Pichai hailed artificial intelligence as an \"extraordinary moment\" but said no company would be immune if bubble burst. A new report by Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) alleges \"systematic killings and cover-ups\". Latest updates from the BBC's specialists in fact-checking, verifying video and tackling disinformation. Donald Tusk said the two suspects had entered Poland from Belarus and had long worked for Russia. Ahead of a vote on the file release, the Republican congresswoman says the Epstein issue has \"ripped Maga apart\" (Trump's Make America Great Again movement). The company says it is working to understand the full impact of a problem which potentially \"impacts multiple customers.\" Following increased US pressure on the Venezuelan government, the two sides say they are open to talks. When an insurer for FBI and CIA agents was sold to a Chinese entity, it led the US to tighten investment laws. Cash transfers, often directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for politicians."

Several dozen people are presumed to have died in the blaze in the resort of Crans-Montana. In an interview with state TV, the Venezuelan president also evaded a question about an attack in his country claimed by the US. Latest updates from the BBC's specialists in fact-checking, verifying video and tackling disinformation. The US president says \"we will come to their rescue\" after days of demonstrations and clashes. Kyrylo Budanov has led the Hur military intelligence, which has claimed a number of highly-effective strikes against Russia. It  marks the first time the Chinese firm has outpaced its American rival for annual sales. Venus Williams, 45, is set to play at the Australian Open for the first time in five years after receiving the final women's wildcard for the tournament. The video shows a man trying to extinguish the flames while music can be heard playing in the background and some people film the fire on their phones. One young man told the BBC he went into the bar to look for his little brother, who he thought was inside."

Will the US push for elections or will it try to depose more members of the government, asks the BBC's Ione Wells. Explosions were seen in capital Caracas as President Nicolas Maduro was detained by the US. Ana Vanessa Herrero is in Caracas and says she began hearing planes at 02:00 local time. The US has been ramping up pressure on the Venezuelan leader since Trump took office last January. It comes after a preliminary investigation found the likely cause was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling. How the blaze took hold with such ferocity, killing at least 40 people and leaving many more critically injured, is now a key focus for officials. The region is preparing for up 2.5ft (.76m) of coastal flooding over the weekend due to rain and increased king tides this time of year. Can the Democratic socialist deliver on the big cost-of-living promises that propelled him to victory? The US president earlier said if peaceful protesters are killed, Washington \"will come to their rescue\"."

He has been described as an avid outdoorsman who loved mountain biking. Sir Mark covered some of the defining moments in India's history in a career that spanned decades. Many parties were banned and there was no voting in about half the country which is gripped by fear and civil war. Bystander footage has captured the seconds before the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti. The Greater Manchester mayor is seen as a potential leadership challenger to Sir Keir Starmer. With economic stagnation and extremes of inequality comes corrosion of trust in democratic institutions. So Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of what Carney called a \"rupture\" with the post-WW2 order. Alex Honnold has become the first person to climb the Taiwanese building alone without safety equipment. Protesters chanted Alex Pretti's name after he became the second person this month to be shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis. Federal and state authorities have offered conflicting versions of what happened in the moments leading to the shooting."

The woman, then in her 20s, says the alleged encounter happened at Royal Lodge in 2010. The 18-year-old Swiss national died at a hospital in Zurich, the local prosecutor said. Marius Borg Høiby, the crown prince's blond stepson, is accused of 38 charges in a case that has attracted global interest. Trump earlier said Iran - which is due to begin a live-fire naval exercise in a key shipping route - was in \"serious discussions\". Medical charity Medicine Sans Frontières said it would not share the list as it had not been able to ensure staff would remain safe. The firm's move comes amid global scrutiny of the methods used by the US immigration enforcement agency. Carlos Alcaraz wins the Australian Open to become the youngest man to complete a career Grand Slam - ending Novak Djokovic's latest attempt to land a 25th major title. The images of Ratner with Epstein and unidentified women were released the same day as his documentary about the US first lady. Three million new documents include hundreds of mentions of Trump and emails between Epstein and a person called \"The Duke\"."

Tom Homan took over the immigration crackdown in Minnesota after two US citizens were killed in incidents with federal agents. The Arizona sheriff says the FBI has reviewed the note, but did not confirm if it was authentic. Police say they were beaten to death, allegedly by the woman's three brothers, who have been arrested.
