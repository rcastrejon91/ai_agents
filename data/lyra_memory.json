Kirk attracted fervent crowds, bringing young people into conservative politics, while at the same time shocking some with provocative opinions.

In an exclusive BBC interview, Sundar Pichai hailed artificial intelligence as an \"extraordinary moment\" but said no company would be immune if bubble burst. A new report by Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) alleges \"systematic killings and cover-ups\". Latest updates from the BBC's specialists in fact-checking, verifying video and tackling disinformation. Donald Tusk said the two suspects had entered Poland from Belarus and had long worked for Russia. Ahead of a vote on the file release, the Republican congresswoman says the Epstein issue has \"ripped Maga apart\" (Trump's Make America Great Again movement). The company says it is working to understand the full impact of a problem which potentially \"impacts multiple customers.\" Following increased US pressure on the Venezuelan government, the two sides say they are open to talks. When an insurer for FBI and CIA agents was sold to a Chinese entity, it led the US to tighten investment laws. Cash transfers, often directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for politicians."

US officials say the rules will stop \"destructive ideologies\" but others argue it is redefining human rights principles for Trump's goals. Several groups - some of them backed by Israel - are ranged against Hamas in Gaza, with complex and overlapping ties. A row over fossil fuels has broken out at COP30 but this is also likely to be a negotiating tactic. A male teacher \"got the whole brunt\" of the attack and some children were hit with bear spray. A scandal-filled pageant season ends with the crowning of a new Miss Universe in Bangkok, Thailand. The US has justified its air and naval campaign as necessary to fight drug smuggling into the US.
