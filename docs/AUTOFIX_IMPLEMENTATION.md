# Self-Healing Autofix Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a robust, self-healing autofix workflow that prevents crashes from broken package.json files and other common issues. The solution replaces the previous basic autofix workflow with a comprehensive script that validates, fixes, and formats code automatically.

## Key Components

### 1. Self-Healing Script (`.github/scripts/autofix.sh`)

The core self-healing script provides:

- **JSON Validation**: Automatically detects and fixes malformed package.json files
- **Trailing Comma Removal**: Fixes common JSON syntax errors
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues workflow even if individual steps fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Provides detailed status updates with timestamps
- **Safe Git Operations**: Handles conflicts and authentication failures gracefully

### 2. Updated Workflow (`.github/workflows/autofix.yml`)

The streamlined workflow:
- Uses the new self-healing script for all operations
- Sets up both Node.js and Python environments
- Runs all formatters through the centralized script
- Provides better error handling and logging

### 3. Configuration Files

Added essential configuration files:
- **eslint.config.js**: ESLint configuration for JavaScript/TypeScript files
- **.prettierrc**: Prettier configuration with YAML support

## Self-Healing Capabilities

### Package.json Validation
```bash
# The script automatically:
1. Finds all package.json files (excluding node_modules)
2. Validates JSON syntax
3. Fixes common issues (trailing commas)
4. Reformats with consistent styling
5. Validates fixes before proceeding
```

### Error Recovery
- **Network timeouts**: Continues with available tools
- **Missing dependencies**: Installs what it can, continues with rest
- **Git conflicts**: Attempts rebase, continues with commit
- **Authentication failures**: Commits locally, reports status

### Safe Operations
- **Backup creation**: Makes backups before attempting fixes
- **Rollback capability**: Restores backups if fixes fail
- **Non-destructive**: Never deletes working code
- **Workflow file protection**: Prevents committing workflow changes

## Testing Results

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:

✅ **Valid JSON files**: All existing package.json files validated successfully  
✅ **Broken JSON repair**: Successfully fixed files with trailing commas  
✅ **Formatter execution**: ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, Black, and isort all run correctly  
✅ **Error handling**: Graceful continuation when individual tools encounter issues  
✅ **Git operations**: Safe commit and push operations with conflict handling  

## Usage

The workflow automatically runs on:
- Push to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

To run manually:
```bash
./.github/scripts/autofix.sh
```

## Benefits

1. **Crash Prevention**: No more workflow failures from malformed JSON
2. **Self-Repair**: Automatically fixes common syntax issues
3. **Robustness**: Continues working even when individual tools fail
4. **Consistency**: Ensures all code follows the same formatting standards
5. **Visibility**: Comprehensive logging shows exactly what was done

## Future Enhancements

The script is designed to be easily extensible for:
- Additional JSON validation rules
- More file types (YAML, TOML, etc.)
- Custom formatting rules
- Integration with additional tools

This implementation makes the autofix workflow significantly more reliable and self-healing, preventing the crashes that were occurring with the previous version.
