# Repository Structure and Deployment Configuration - Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Removed Sensitive Files
- Removed SSH key files: `Ca199106!` and `Ca199106!.pub`
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future sensitive file commits

### ✅ 2. Fixed Build Issues in `apps/companion_web`
- Removed `next-auth/react` dependency issue in security module
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in API routes
- Fixed regex compatibility issues
- Ensured all security headers work with both NextApiResponse and NextResponse

### ✅ 3. Consolidated GitHub Workflows
- Removed duplicate `web.yml` workflow file
- Kept the comprehensive `deploy-web.yml` with proper path filtering and environment settings
- Workflow correctly targets `apps/companion_web` directory

### ✅ 4. Removed Duplicate/Confusing Directories
Removed legacy directories that were causing confusion:
- `frontend/` - Old Next.js app
- `lyra/` - Legacy backend/frontend structure
- `lyra-ai/` - Another legacy version with Docker
- `lyra_admin/` - Legacy Python admin app
- `lyra_app/` - Legacy Python app with ML models

### ✅ 5. Standardized Deployment Configuration
- Removed conflicting root `vercel.json` that pointed to old directories
- Kept proper `apps/companion_web/vercel.json` with Next.js framework configuration
- Verified deployment workflow uses correct working directory

### ✅ 6. Updated Repository Structure
- Enhanced `.gitignore` with comprehensive rules for:
  - SSH keys and sensitive files
  - Build artifacts
  - Database files
  - Logs and OS files
- Cleaned up obsolete directory references

## Current Repository Structure

```

├── apps/
│   ├── companion_web/     # ✅ Next.js web application (Vercel deployment target)
│   └── companion_api/     # ✅ TypeScript API application
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy-web.yml # ✅ Consolidated deployment workflow
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── agents/               # AI agent modules
├── [other root files]    # Core system files
└── .gitignore           # ✅ Enhanced with security rules
```

## Verification Tests

All deployment configuration tests pass:
- ✅ Required files exist in `apps/companion_web`
- ✅ Next.js framework properly configured in `vercel.json`
- ✅ Build and start scripts present in `package.json`
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Root directory cleanup completed
- ✅ GitHub workflow correctly configured
- ✅ Duplicate files removed

## Deployment Ready

The repository is now properly structured for Vercel deployment:

1. **For Vercel Dashboard Setup:**
   - Import repository in Vercel
   - Set root directory to `apps/companion_web`
   - Configure environment variables as needed
   - Deploy

2. **For GitHub Actions Deployment:**
   - Workflow triggers on changes to `apps/companion_web/**`
   - Builds in correct directory
   - Supports both PR previews and production deploys
   - Requires secrets: `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

## Security Improvements

- Removed SSH keys from repository
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive file commits
- Updated security module to work without auth dependencies
- Maintained security headers and input validation

The repository structure is now clean, secure, and optimized for modern deployment workflows.
